# Awesome Python Repos
A Collection of Awesome Python Repositories. To contribute, please check the `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

### Why Another Collection of Repositories?

Yes, it is true that there are a lot of repos out there for you to get a collection of project repositories. This is not any different!

You can add your awesome repo here and to other collections as well. It just helps to create a network so that if a person doesn't get what he was looking for in other repos, he will still have more options to look and collaborate. Well that's what OpenSource is, right?

### Structure

This is the main page of the repository and all other project/repository links are stored in there respective folders.

For example,

If there is a project related to computer vision, then its link will be in [ComputerVision](./ComputerVision) folder.

Similarly, all game developement related projects gets featured in [GameDev](./GameDev) folder.

If there is a need to create a new folder, please create a PR or an issue to highlight the same.

### How To Add Your Repo?

Go to the respective folder where your project fits the most. For example, I want to add a project to [GameDev](./GameDev) folder, then I will go to its [README.md](./GameDev/README.md) file and add my github username in details tags with the project links, like below:

```md
<details>
